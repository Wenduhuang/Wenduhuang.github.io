        <p>My name is Wendy Huang. I was born in Taiwan and the school there was very competitive. Students were trained to study under pressure and exams were giving every week. Parents have such high expectations on their children and therefore I was trained to become what I am today. I am capable of handling most of the big projects within a short amount of time and never procrastinated. I have the ability to stay highly organized with great attention to details. Over the years, Iâ€™ve had many experiences and opportunities in creating design projects for school, church and working place. During my time at Otis College of Art and Design, I have taken many courses involving graphic/web design, motion graphic, and typography. These in class projects have earned me all software skills necessary to create work independently. Currently I am taking web programming course at school and therefore have the basic coding knowledge and web design experience. Furthermore, besides designing, I am also a professional pianist and have experience in performing in a band and providing lessons on piano and music theory. If I we have the chance to collaborate, I will put my best effort to contribute high quality work.</p>
