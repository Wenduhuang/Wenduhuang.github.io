        <h1>The Web's Grain</h1>
        <p>The Web’s Grain gives readers an overview of designing for the web. A website must look good on many different screen sizes. According to Frank Chimero, “edgelessness is in the web’s structure: it’s comprised of individual pages linked together, so its structure can branch out forever.” This means instead of contents displaying in a single shot, the infinite canvas allows any devices to display more contents by allowing viewers to scroll in any directions for however long. The sizes of what we are making is unknown until we know what we’re putting there. So, it’s better to come up with an arrangement of elements and assign them to a size, rather than the other way around.

In order for readers to better understand his concept and method, he provided examples of David Hockney’s art. David Hockney began with an image-making practice that relied on the grid necessitated by the Polaroids’ borders and produced a rectangular final work. Later, he abandoned the notion that a two-dimensional work of art needed to exist at a fixed, rectangular size. Instead, small individual photos were overlaid and assembled until they formed a complete picture. 

Frank Chimero also compare Hockney’s work with the painting of Mona Lisa. Mona Lisa have a fixed and uniform edges that can be planned for with a high degree of control and certainty. It is the type of design apply to a printed pages rather than a web design screen. In contrast, Hockney’s the Scrabble Game does not required a fixed proportion. The size is unknown and can be used flexibly which is more efficient when designing a web page. 

Overall, I can say that his design concept is very successful. Although the article for me is a very deep reading and I had to read twice to understand the text and what it’s trying to communicate, I believe the concept I’ve learned from the article will benefit me for my web design skills in this class. In addition about the 250 words response, I chose to write a summary of the article; therefore, whenever I look back I’ll always have an overview of what this article is about. </p>
