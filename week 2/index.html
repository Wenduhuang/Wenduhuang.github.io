        <p>Remember those crazy ideas you dreamed up as a kid? The museum of ice-cream is the place where ideas are transformed into real life experiences a place where flavors are mysteries, toppings are toys and sprinkles make the world a better place. Our mission is to design environments that bring people together and provoke imagination.</p>
        <p>Summer is almost here. And so of course, we want to bring you a little taste of what's to come. We are talking ice cream, of course. But it's being served up in a unique way in Los Angeles. There is a newly opened museum of ice cream there, a surreal homage to my favorite dessert, which calls itself quote, "a place where flavors are mysteries, toppings are toys and sprinkles make the world a better place." Maryellis Bunn is the co-founder of the museum, and she joins us now.</p>
